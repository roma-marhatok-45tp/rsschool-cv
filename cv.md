# Summary
I started to study programming in 2020 when I entered my sophomore year of college. Through college, I became more active in this area and found my best friends. My main goal in this area is to become a sought-after specialist in the backend component of my profession. Although I don't learn very quickly, I compensate for this with my persistence.
